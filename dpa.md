# Introduction

This document provides guidance for creating an agreement for privacy and security standards related to the development of an exposure alerting software solution (“Software”). While the law provides a backdrop for the protection of and requirements for the processing of personal data as well as data that constitute government records, it does not necessarily answer the question of how commercial relations and data rights must be structured in all possible Software deployments. To foster the necessary trust in Software that will lead to popular use, and thus make Software effective for public health objectives, U.S. Digital Response encourages the implementation of data protection accountability mechanisms for both public and private entities. This model data protection agreement (“DPA”) helps provide such accountability, and so U.S. Digital Response makes this DPA publicly available.

This model DPA considers existing data protection laws and regulations as a baseline and prescribes a framework with a high standard of data governance, and by providing this as a proposed contractual agreement, it creates an enforceable mechanism for additional accountability. The DPA also assimilates considerations from Privacy By Design, Fair Information Principle Practices, thought leadership from a variety of interested stakeholders including privacy, security and civil liberty organizations, government agencies, industry and technology companies and associations, as well as public health professionals, including the CDC and epidemiologists. However, it is important to note that information and guidance pertaining to the COVID-19 pandemic changes on a daily – if not hourly – basis and may become stale very quickly. Parties are thus encouraged to consider the most updated regulatory and public health guidance as appropriate. In addition, this DPA is designed as a starting point to flexibly cover a broad range of potential data governance scenarios. Particular circumstances—including the technology requirements—may differ. We suggest the parties tailor the DPA to address particular circumstances with the advice of legal counsel.

**These model provisions do not constitute legal advice, and are not intended to be used as a replacement for advice of counsel.**

**“Consultant Data”** means data relating to the operation, performance, support and/or use of the Software.  Consultant Data may include any Personal Data that the User has not consented to provide to Client pursuant to the terms of the applicable privacy policy, but which must be collected for the operation of the Software.

**“User”** means any natural person that uses the Software, or otherwise is considered a consumer or data subject under applicable Data Protection Law.

**“Secondary Use”** is any use of Personal Data collected from the Software that is not aligned with the context in which it was collected, the Purpose(s) and the Objective(s) that were disclosed to the User at the time of collection.

## 2. Data Protection Requirements
The parties agree that the Software shall be developed with a commitment to data privacy and security best practices, ethical data use, and compliance with applicable Data Protection Laws.

### 2.1 Purpose
The parties will define each Purpose(s) to address a specific public healthneed that the Software intends to solve, and restrict use of the Software for any other Purpose(s).  For the avoidance of doubt, purposes that are not permitted include, but are not limited to, the following: law enforcement, immigration enforcement, tax collection, or commercial marketing.

**2.5.1** Personal Data shall be retained only as long as necessary to fulfill  Objective(s) and stated Purpose(s), and then securely destroyed.

**2.5.2** The parties intend for Personal Data collected by Software to be destroyed when Software either achieves its Objective(s) or Software is unable to achieve Objective(s). 

**2.5.3** Where the need or use of Personal Data is not clear, there shall be a presumption of privacy and the default settings shall be the most privacy protective. 

**2.5.4** Software shall be designed to prevent the observability of exposure alert communications to other Users other than those expressly authorized by the User.

**2.5.5** Software shall be designed to maximize use of anonymization, pseudonymization, encryption, decentralization and localized device-level data processing technologies.

When applicable, the privacy notice should also disclose the creation, use and disclosure of Deidentified Data.

**2.6.2** Client and Consultant shall issue weekly transparency reports that are publicly available and that inform the public, on an aggregate level, about: data sharing, data trends, Software adoption, and success in achieving Objective(s); additionally, Consultant shall be transparent about legal requests from government and non-government actors for the disclosure of User information and any responses to such requests.

**2.6.6** At least 72 hours prior to deploying Software or new versions or significant updates, the full source code, hardware, and/or firmware designs should be publicly available for evaluation. A full protocol specification should be available, including test data. An independent security audit of the source code by a reputed security representative should also be available and publicly announced alongside the announcement of the update.
