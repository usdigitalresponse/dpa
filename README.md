# Data Privacy Agreement

U.S. Digital Response connects governments with experienced, pro bono technologists to provide rapid, effective response to the COVID-19 crisis. We are a volunteer-run and non-partisan team. As government leaders determine what role exposure alerting apps will play in opening society back up, we considered how our government partners can protect privacy and build trust with the public so these apps could achieve the high adoption rate necessary to make them effective.

One way to build trust is with a data governance program that prioritizes privacy, security and transparency. We drafted this model Data Protection Agreement to provide government and app developers with a data protection accountability mechanism that safeguards the privacy of individuals’ data and encourages transparency at every stage of an app’s development and deployment.
